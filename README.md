## Overview
This project was developed in 3 days for a hackathon with the theme of creating a website for an NGO. The NGO aims to provide education to underprivileged children. The website is built using **React**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and uses **Redux** for state management. The app is mobile-responsive, engaging, and highlights the NGO's core values and mission.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Implements modern, utility-first styling.
- **Redux**: Manages the global state for user interactions, forms, and more.
- **Dynamic Image Galleries**: Display images highlighting the NGO's activities.
- **Interactive Forms**: Volunteer sign-up forms and donation sections are interactive and functional.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Well-structured components for easy maintenance and scalability.
